# LGBTQ+ Rights in Costa Rica

## Homosexuality
Homosexual relations have been legal since [1971](https://ilga.org/downloads/2017/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2017_WEB.pdf). The President of Costa Rica [issued a formal apology in 2018](https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/politica/presidente-carlos-alvarado-pide-perdon-a-personas/FIZJFLCNFZDJZLCVXTRSEM3YW4/story/) for past discriminations against LGBT+ people, even after homosexuality was legalized.

## Gender Transition
Gender identity has been able to be changed on legal documentation since [2013](https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/cedula-otorga-una-nueva-identidad-a-hombre-trans/FKWWUTIDCBAMNHERNIZM6HRJBY/story/), but it requires a judicial order.

## Same-Sex Marriage
Same-sex marriage has been recognized since 2020 ([*CIRCULAR NÂ° 113-2018*](https://www.imprentanacional.go.cr/pub-boletin/2018/11//bol_26_11_2018.pdf)).

## Same-Sex Adoption
Same-sex adoption has been allowed since 2020.

## Military
Costa Rica does not have a military. However, LGBT+ citizens are allowed to serve openly in the country's [Public Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Force_of_Costa_Rica).

## Discrimination Laws
The Costa Rican Constitution does not explicitly mention protections for LGBT+ citizens, but Article 33 states that everyone is equal under the law.

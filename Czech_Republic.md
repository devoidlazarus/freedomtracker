# LGBTQ+ Rights in the Czech Republic

## Homosexuality
Homosexual relations have been legal since 1962, with the introduction of the country's [current Criminal Code](http://www.ejtn.eu/PageFiles/6533/Criminal%20Code%20of%20the%20Czech%20Republic.pdf).

## Gender Transition
[Sex-reassignment surgery is required](https://www.denik.cz/z_domova/operacni-zmenu-pohlavi-podstoupi-v-cr-rocne-50-az-60-lidi-20121129.html) in order to change gender identity on legal documents. Additionally, trans citizens must wait upwards of 2 years before the surgery is allowed to occur.

## Same-Sex Marriage
Same-sex couples are legally recognized, and can be recognized as a [registered partnership](http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/same-sex-registered-partnerships-to-be-introduced-after-deputies-override-presidential-veto) since 2006. However, same-sex marriage is not recognized in the same way.

## Same-Sex Adoption
There are no known laws allowing same-sex couples to adopt children. 

## Military
LGBT+ citizens have been allowed to serve openly since [2015](https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/ceska-armada-se-vojaku-na-zmenu-pohlavi-nepta-trump-transsex/r~d5ad29cc72bc11e79c3f0025900fea04/).

## Discrimination Laws
LGBT+ citizens have been protected from discrimination since 2009 ([*Antidiskriminační zákon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_Czech_Republic#cite_note-33)).

# LGBTQ+ Rights in Haiti

## Homosexuality
Homosexual relations have been legal since 1791, when French-controlled Haiti followed in the repealing of France's sodomy laws. The current [Haitian Penal Code](https://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/fr/ht/ht010fr.pdf) makes no mention of criminalizing homosexual activity.

## Gender Transition
There are no known laws allowing one's gender identity to be changed on legal documentation.

## Same-Sex Marriage
Same-sex unions are not recognized by the country.

## Same-Sex Adoption
There are no known laws allowing same-sex couples to adopt children.

## Military
Haiti does not have a military.

## Discrimination Laws
There are no known laws protecting LGBT+ citizens from discrimination. However, the President of Haiti passed a new [penal code](https://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/fr/ht/ht010fr.pdf) in 2020 which would criminalize discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and the Haitian Parliament has 24 months to reject it.

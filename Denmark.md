# LGBTQ+ Rights in Denmark

## Homosexuality
Homosexual relations have been legal since 1933 ([*LBK nr 909*](https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/2005/909)).

## Gender Transition
Gender identity has been freely able to be changed on legal documentation since [2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20150212093918/http://www.lgbt-ep.eu/press-releases/denmark-becomes-europes-leading-country-on-legal-gender-recognition/). However, transgender citizens must go through a six-month long "reflection period" after they apply before anything is changed. [X is also available as a gender marker](https://tgeu.org/denmark-x-in-passports-and-new-trans-law-work/) on Danish passports.

## Same-Sex Marriage
Same-sex marriage has been legal since [2012](http://cphpost.dk/news/national/gay-marriage-legalised).

## Discrimination Laws
LGB citizens have been protected under anti-discrimination laws ([*LOV OM FORBUD MOD FORSKELSBEHANDLING PÃ… ARBEJDSMARKEDET M.V.*](https://bm.dk/media/9577/vejledning-om-forskelsbehandlingsloven.pdf)) since 1996. While gender identity is not explicitly mentioned as a protected category, [transgender citizens have been protected](https://panbloggen.wordpress.com/2015/07/29/michelle-var-udsat-for-diskrimination-som-transkvinde/) under this law in the past.
